### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am an 18 year old aspiring developer from the Netherlands. I co-founded [Skynode Hosting](https://skynode.pro/) back in 2017 and have been maintaining it's software, network and infrastructure since then.

I also started [Tickety](https://tickety.net/) in 2018 which was the *first ever* support ticket discord bot, followed by a lot of imitations. Tickety has been a very succesful project of mine, however I've decided to sell it to allocate my time elsewhere.

I find joy in tackling new issues that arrive when coding, and I always try my best to learn from them.
